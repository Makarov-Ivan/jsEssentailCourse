# JS Essential Course Code

## Motivation

This is a repository for my code, partially inspired be this [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training?dApp=53239054&leis=LAA&u=2113185)

## Repo structure

Each folder contains some code, that references the chapter from the course in its name.

For example, directory 3_5 means that code in it is from a course chapter 3, part 5.
